I am **Juan Ortega**, a Ph.D. student in Engineering Sciences (Mechanical Engineering) at the [Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile](https://www.uc.cl/). I also hold a B.Sc. in Physics from the [Universidad de Concepción](https://www.udec.cl/).

I conduct my research at **[The Hidden Heart Lab](https://hiddenheartlab.org/)**, under the supervision of Professor Francisco Sahli Costabal. My work focuses on the intersection of **computational mechanics**, **cardiac electrophysiology**, and **Scientific Machine Learning (Scientific ML)**.

My main goal is to develop efficient computational models that combine classical physics with neural networks (PINNs) to improve the simulation and understanding of cardiac pathologies.

### Areas of Interest

* **Scientific Machine Learning:** Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) and SINDy.
* **Cardiac Modeling:** Eikonal Equation, anisotropic tensors, and fluid dynamics.
* **Scientific Computing:** Development of differentiable solvers in Python (**JAX**) and MATLAB.
