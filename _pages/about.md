I am **Juan Ortega**, a Bachelor of Science in Physics and a current Ph.D. student in Engineering Sciences with a specialization in Mechanical Engineering at the [Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile](https://www.uc.cl/). 

I conduct my research at **[The Hidden Heart Lab](https://hiddenheartlab.org/)**, under the supervision of Professor Francisco Sahli Costabal. My work is focused on the intersection of **computational mechanics**, **cardiac electrophysiology**, and **Scientific Machine Learning (Scientific ML)**.

My main goal is to develop efficient computational models that combine classical physics with neural networks (PINNs) to improve the simulation and understanding of cardiac pathologies.

### Areas of Interest

* **Scientific Machine Learning:** Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs).
* **Cardiac Modeling:** Eikonal Equation, anisotropic tensors, fluid dynamics.
* **Scientific Computing:** Development of differentiable solvers in Python (**JAX**) and MATLAB.
